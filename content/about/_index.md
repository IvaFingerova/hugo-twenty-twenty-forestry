This is an awesome example of me being rebellious and instead of going offline, testing new website builder :D YAY - tomorrow morning will be painful again :D

Basically I'd love to build my own site for MOJETVOJE, perhaps even add a shopify lite widget to sell some merch when it will come to it. But first things first - what is MOJETVOJE and why am I doing it? 

I remembered my childhood favourite activity we did with my grandma together - she taught me it all - crocheting and like so many people during covid lockdowns I was restless and needed to create something so I started with crotcheting caps and headbands and neckbands even one unexpected baret:) 

The other motivation is also money - but not in the way that probably comes to your mind rightaway. I was astonished how much does quality příze costs and when I found out how much I overpaid for my favourite Alpaka+silk cap it made me think further - OK, so the material cost is one thing - the other is someones time and skill so I started timing how  long does it take me to create one cap without any mistakes made.

And you know what? After a week of practicing, I got quite quick at it and was more confident about sizing the right product, but still there wasn't the proper skill that would make the beanie look as if it was manufactured professionally (on some kind of device...).
